## Project Description: Real-Time Chat Application
The Real-Time Chat Application is a responsive web-based messaging system developed using React.js for the front-end and WebSockets for real-time communication. The primary goal of this project was to create a smooth and interactive chat platform where users can exchange messages instantly without refreshing the page.

The chat interface is designed to be simple, clean, and fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across both desktop and mobile devices. Users can send and receive messages in real time, and all message history remains visible in the chat window, providing an ongoing conversation thread.

This project helped me gain hands-on experience in:

Setting up WebSocket servers

Managing live WebSocket connections

Building dynamic and responsive React components

Handling real-time data flow between the client and the server
